# Image_Processing 
This is one of the assignment of Princeton University based on Image Processing

1) I try to process certain input images based on certain features and filters. As a reference follow this link:                
https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring14/cos426/assignment1/examples.html

2) OS - Windows, IDE - Pycharm. One can use Anaconda Platforms (Spider, Jupiter notebook etc.) 

Pre-requirement to run this project:
1) Create a virtual environment {both for Anaconda, Pycharm}. 
  1.1) For anaconda using command line refer: 
       https://salishsea-meopar-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/work_env/python3_conda_environment.html
  1.2) For Pycharm IDE, please refer:
       https://arcade.academy/venv_install/index.html

2) Using command line, cd: to reach into virtual environment. Example = 'D:\Datasets\pythonProject\Princeton_IP\img_pro' {where img_pro is my vr name}. (Change path accordingly)
4) Manually install packages using PIP - NumPy, PILLOW, OpenCV 
   pip install opencv-python numpy PIL 
   'OR' 
   pip install -r requirment.txt
5) All the scripts lies here: 'D:\Datasets\pythonProject\Princeton_IP\img_pro'
