# Image_Processing
--> This is one of the assignment of Princeton University based on Image Processing

--> I try to process certain input images based on certain features and filters. I followed this link as a reference to implement certain filters: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring14/cos426/assignment1/examples.html

--> I am using Windows 10 and Pycharm as my IDE to implement this project. 
One can also use Anaconda Platforms (Spider, Jupiter notebook etc.) 

Pre-requirement to run this project:
1) Create a virtual environment {both for Anaconda, Pycharm}. 
For anaconda using command line refer: 
https://salishsea-meopar-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/work_env/python3_conda_environment.html
For Pycharm IDE, please refer:
https://arcade.academy/venv_install/index.html

2) Using command line, cd: to reach into virtual environment. Example = 'D:\Datasets\pythonProject\Princeton_IP\img_pro' {where img_pro is my vr name}. Change path accordingly
3) Thereafter using PIP: install packages - NumPy, PILLOW, OpenCV {pip install opencv-python numpy PIL} or {pip install -r requirment.txt}
4) All the scripts are lies here: 'D:\Datasets\pythonProject\Princeton_IP\img_pro'
